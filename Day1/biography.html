<h1>Biography of Nikola Tesla</h1>
<h2>Nikola Tesla (1856 – 1943)</h2>
<p>Nikola Tesla was one of the greatest inventors, electrical engineers, and futurists in history. He was born on 10 July 1856 in Smiljan, a village in modern-day Croatia (then part of the Austrian Empire).</p>

<h2>Early Life</h2>
<p>Tesla’s father, Milutin Tesla, was a priest, and his mother, Đuka Mandić, had a talent for making household tools, which inspired his creativity.

From childhood, Tesla showed an extraordinary memory and imagination.

He studied engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz and later attended the University of Prague, though he did not complete his degree.</p>

<h2>Career and Inventions</h2>
<p>Tesla worked in Europe before moving to the United States in 1884, where he briefly worked with Thomas Edison.

Their approaches differed: Edison supported Direct Current (DC), while Tesla promoted Alternating Current (AC), which later became the standard for power transmission.

Tesla’s inventions include:

Alternating Current (AC) system

Tesla Coil (used in radio and wireless technology)

Induction motor

Radio transmission experiments (he competed with Guglielmo Marconi)

Remote control

Early ideas of wireless electricity and even concepts similar to radar and X-rays</p>

<h2>Major Achievements</h2>
<p>His AC system was used in the Niagara Falls power plant (1895), one of the first large-scale hydroelectric plants in the world.

He held more than 300 patents worldwide.

Though many of his futuristic ideas (like wireless global energy) were never completed, they influenced modern technologies like Wi-Fi, robotics, and wireless communication.</p>

<h2>Later Life</h2>
<p>Tesla is remembered as a visionary inventor who dreamed of free energy for all.

The unit of magnetic field strength in the SI system is named “tesla” (T) in his honor.

Today, his name is widely known, not just because of his inventions but also due to companies like Tesla, Inc., which was named after him.</p>
